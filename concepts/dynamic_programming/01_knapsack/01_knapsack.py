"""
Imagine that you have a knapsack which can carry a certain maximum amount of weight
and you have a set of items with their own weight and a monetary value.
You are going to to sell your items in the market but you can only carry what fits in the knapsack.
How do you maximize the amount of money that you can earn?


Given a list of items with values and weights, as well as a max weight,
find the maximum value you can generate from items,
where the sum of the weights is less than or equal to the max. eg.

items = {(w:2, v:6), (w:2, v:10), (w:3, v:12)}
max weight = 5
knapsack(items, max weight) = 22
